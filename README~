Google-GeoCoder-Smart version 0.01
==================================

This module provides a simple and "Smart" interface to the Google Maps geocoding API. 
It is based on the current format of the xml returned by the API. If Google changes their format, 
this module might stop working. The only dependency that this module has is the LWP::Simple module, 
and its sub-dependencies. I wanted something that was adaptable and would return results 
automaticaly formatted for perl. I am planning to add a validate function to tell how 
close the returned match is to the original address passed to the module. 
If you find any bugs, please let me know.
